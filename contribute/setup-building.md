| Git        | The source code of Pulsar is hosted on GitHub as a git repository. To work with the git repository, please [install git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).                                                         |
| JDK        | The source code of Pulsar is almost written in Java. Therefore, you need a working Java Development Kit (JDK) to build it. Pulsar requires [JDK 17](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17) to build. |
| Maven      | The source code of Pulsar is managed by [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) The required Maven version is 3.6.1+.                                                                                          |
| Zip        | The build process requires Zip as a utility tool.                                                                                                                                                                |

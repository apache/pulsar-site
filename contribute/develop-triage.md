title: Triaging an Issue
---

This guide documents the [issue tracker](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues) for users and developers.

## Checklist for Triaging

* [ ] Read the initial message and the comments.
* [ ] Check that the title is reasonably concise, while including enough specifics so that those scanning the list of issues can quickly identify its topic.
* [ ] Leave a brief comment about the proposed next action needed. If there is a long message list, a summary can be very helpful.
* [ ] (Committers-only) Set all the relevant [labels](develop-labels).
* [ ] (Committers-only) Where appropriate, set the Assignees, Reviewers, Milestone fields, and possibly @mention relevant people.
* [ ] (Committers-only) If the issue is clearly invalid (unrelated to Pulsar, duplicate, spam, etc), you can close it as ["not planned"](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-05-19-the-new-github-issues-may-19th-update/).

## Assignees

This field indicates who is expected to take the next step in resolving the issue.

Since the Pulsar community follows [Community of Peers](https://www.apache.org/theapacheway/) pattern, a contributor is assigned to an issue only if they ask for or self-assign. GitHub only allows team members or participants to be assigned, and asking for an assignment simplifies this restriction.

## Helping Triage Issues

Once you know your way around how Pulsar's source files are structured and you are comfortable with the workflow, a great way to contribute is to help triage issues. Do realize, though, that experience working on Pulsar is needed in order to effectively help triage.

Around the clock, new issues are being opened on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues) and existing issues are being updated. Every issue needs to be triaged to make sure everything runs smoothly.

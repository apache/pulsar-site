title: Triaging an Issue
---

This guide documents the [issue tracker](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues) for users and developers.

## Checklist for Triaging

* [ ] Read the initial message and the comments.
* [ ] Check that the title is reasonably concise, while including enough specifics so that those scanning the list of issues can quickly identify its topic.
* [ ] Leave a brief comment about the proposed next action needed. If there is a long message list, a summary can be very helpful.
* [ ] (Committers-only) Set all the relevant [labels](develop-labels).
* [ ] (Committers-only) Where appropriate, set the Assignees, Reviewers, Milestone fields, and possibly @mention relevant people.
* [ ] (Committers-only) If the issue is clearly invalid (unrelated to Pulsar, duplicate, spam, etc), you can close it as ["not planned"](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-05-19-the-new-github-issues-may-19th-update/).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Apache Pulsar community is thrilled to announce the launch of Apache Pulsar 4.0, a new LTS release!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-new-in-apache-pulsar-40-lts-since-pulsar-30-lts">What's new in Apache Pulsar 4.0 LTS since Pulsar 3.0 LTS?<a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/blog/2024/10/24/announcing-apache-pulsar-4-0/#whats-new-in-apache-pulsar-40-lts-since-pulsar-30-lts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What's new in Apache Pulsar 4.0 LTS since Pulsar 3.0 LTS?" title="Direct link to What's new in Apache Pulsar 4.0 LTS since Pulsar 3.0 LTS?">​</a></h2>
<p>Pulsar 4.0 <a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/release-notes/versioned/pulsar-4.0.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">includes numerous Pulsar Improvement Proposals (PIPs)</a> since the previous LTS release Pulsar 3.0 in May 2023. These improvements have enhanced the platform's capabilities across multiple areas.</p>
<p>Since there's a lot of new features and improvements, this blog post will only highlight a few of the recent updates. Apache Pulsar contributors are invited to contribute additional blog posts with more details about the new features and improvements.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="enhanced-key_shared-subscription-scale-without-compromising-message-order">Enhanced Key_Shared Subscription: Scale Without Compromising Message Order<a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/blog/2024/10/24/announcing-apache-pulsar-4-0/#enhanced-key_shared-subscription-scale-without-compromising-message-order" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Enhanced Key_Shared Subscription: Scale Without Compromising Message Order" title="Direct link to Enhanced Key_Shared Subscription: Scale Without Compromising Message Order">​</a></h3>
<p><strong>Key_Shared subscription</strong> is one of Pulsar's most valuable features, enabling organizations to scale their message processing capacity by adding multiple consumers while maintaining strict message ordering based on keys. This capability is crucial for applications requiring both high throughput and ordered processing, such as financial transactions, event processing, and real-time analytics.</p>
<p>In Pulsar 4.0, we've improved the Key_Shared subscription implementation through a significant enhancement with <a href="https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pip/pip-379.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PIP-379 Key_Shared Draining Hashes for Improved Message Ordering</a>. The new design ensures messages with the same key are handled by only one consumer at a time, while eliminating unnecessary message blocking that previously impacted system performance during consumer changes and application restarts.</p>
<p>Operations teams can quickly identify and resolve any Key_Shared ordered message delivery issues through comprehensive troubleshooting metrics in Pulsar topic stats.
Future improvements will introduce a REST API that will further simplify troubleshooting by providing direct access to unacknowledged message details and powerful key-based search capabilities for resolving message delivery issues where typically the root cause is in an application that doesn't acknowledge a message and due to message ordering constraints, further messages for the key are blocked. Web based user interfaces and CLI tools can build upon this REST API, allowing also automation for resolving or alerting in operations. Related Key_shared troubleshooting metrics will also be exposed via Prometheus and OTel interfaces in future updates.</p>
<p>You can learn more about the Key_Shared subscription preserving order of message delivery by key and related troubleshooting capabilities in the <a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/4.0.x/concepts-messaging/#preserving-order-of-message-delivery-by-key" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pulsar documentation</a>.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="enhanced-secure-docker-image-runtime-based-on-alpine-and-java-21">Enhanced Secure Docker Image Runtime Based on Alpine and Java 21<a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/blog/2024/10/24/announcing-apache-pulsar-4-0/#enhanced-secure-docker-image-runtime-based-on-alpine-and-java-21" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Enhanced Secure Docker Image Runtime Based on Alpine and Java 21" title="Direct link to Enhanced Secure Docker Image Runtime Based on Alpine and Java 21">​</a></h3>
<p>Pulsar 4.0 contains enhancements to its Docker runtime environment, combining the security benefits of Alpine Linux with the performance improvements of Java 21's runtime. <strong>PIP-324</strong> introduced in Pulsar 3.3.0 aligns with our commitment to providing a secure, efficient, and resource-optimized platform for messaging workloads.</p>
<p>The new Docker images are now based on Alpine Linux instead of Ubuntu, reducing the image size while improving the security posture.</p>
<p>A key security enhancement is the elimination of CVEs in the base image. While the previous Ubuntu-based images carried 12 Medium/Low CVEs with no available resolution, the new Alpine-based images start with zero CVEs, providing a more secure foundation for production deployments. This improvement is particularly valuable for organizations with strict security requirements and compliance needs.</p>
<p>The Docker images now include Java 21 with Generational ZGC, bringing significant improvements in garbage collection performance. Generational ZGC provides sub-millisecond pause times, better CPU utilization, and improved memory efficiency compared to previous garbage collectors. This translates to more predictable latencies and better resource utilization for Pulsar deployments.</p>
<p>These improvements make Pulsar 4.0's Docker runtime an even more compelling choice for organizations requiring both security and performance in their messaging infrastructure. The combination of Alpine Linux's minimal attack surface and Java 21's advanced garbage collection provides a robust foundation for running Pulsar in containerized environments.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="enhanced-quality-of-service-qos-controls">Enhanced Quality of Service (QoS) Controls<a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/blog/2024/10/24/announcing-apache-pulsar-4-0/#enhanced-quality-of-service-qos-controls" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Enhanced Quality of Service (QoS) Controls" title="Direct link to Enhanced Quality of Service (QoS) Controls">​</a></h3>
<p>Multi-tenancy in messaging systems presents unique architectural challenges, particularly around resource isolation and predictable performance. Apache Pulsar's approach to this has centered on providing granular control over system resources while maintaining consistency across tenant workloads.</p>
<p>The core advancement in Pulsar 4.0 comes through <a href="https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pip/pip-322.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PIP-322 Pulsar Rate Limiting Refactoring</a>. At its foundation is a token bucket algorithm implementation that unifies rate limiting across broker, topic, and resource group levels. This eliminates the previous split between "default" and "precise" rate limiters—a design choice that had introduced unnecessary CPU overhead and lock contention in IO threads.</p>
<p>The practical impact is straightforward: more predictable performance in multi-tenant deployments, especially when multiple rate limiting conditions intersect. While Pulsar already supports producer rate limiting, the community is building on this foundation with <a href="https://lists.apache.org/thread/9wddmj4o5mrdst427r40rr7phqb05y6s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PIP-385</a> to improve producer flow control — a key piece in completing Pulsar's end-to-end QoS capabilities.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="rate-limiting-and-capacity-management-in-modern-messaging-platforms">Rate Limiting and Capacity Management in Modern Messaging Platforms<a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/blog/2024/10/24/announcing-apache-pulsar-4-0/#rate-limiting-and-capacity-management-in-modern-messaging-platforms" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Rate Limiting and Capacity Management in Modern Messaging Platforms" title="Direct link to Rate Limiting and Capacity Management in Modern Messaging Platforms">​</a></h4>
<p>Rate limiting in Pulsar 4.0 sets the groundwork for a more comprehensive approach to capacity management. The goal is simple: enable dynamic resource allocation while maintaining strict performance guarantees, particularly in environments where workload patterns are unpredictable.</p>
<p>This matters because traditional auto-scaling approaches, which typically respond to CPU or memory metrics, often fall short in messaging systems. Andy Warfield's <a href="https://youtu.be/sc3J4McebHE?feature=shared&amp;t=1335" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">analysis of S3 storage workloads highlighted a pattern</a> that's equally relevant in messaging: workloads are inherently bursty, characterized by sharp peaks amid periods of relative quiet. Traditional auto-scaling can't effectively handle these patterns without significant overprovisioning.</p>
<p>The industry has been converging on solutions to this challenge. <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc22/presentation/elhemali" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon DynamoDB's admission control system</a> and <a href="https://me.0xffff.me/dbaas3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TiDB's resource control framework</a> demonstrate practical approaches to managing capacity in multi-tenant environments. Both systems use token bucket algorithms for base rate limiting but extend beyond this to dynamic quota management.</p>
<p>The solution lies in sophisticated capacity management systems that can smooth out these peaks across a platform's total capacity. This approach aligns perfectly with Marc Brooker's insights into <a href="https://brooker.co.za/blog/2020/08/06/erlang.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the economics of load-balanced systems</a>, where the efficiency gains of cloud-native architectures become most apparent at scale.</p>
<p>Pulsar's resource group concept, introduced with <a href="https://github.com/apache/pulsar/wiki/PIP-82%3A-Tenant-and-namespace-level-rate-limiting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PIP 82: Tenant and namespace level rate limiting</a> in Pulsar 2.8 in June 2021, laid initial groundwork for similar capabilities. While the documentation needs expansion, the technical foundation is solid. The token bucket implementation from PIP-322 provides the basis for evolution toward dynamic quota management and admission control, working in concert with Pulsar's load balancing to manage capacity effectively.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, this creates a path toward more sophisticated capacity management: dynamic limit adjustment based on real-time load, cross-tenant prioritization, and precise capacity allocation to specific tenants or namespaces. The focus is on handling demanding workloads while maintaining performance predictability—without the traditional answer of overprovisioning.</p>
<p>The development of these capabilities remains open and community-driven. Technical discussions and decisions happen in the open on the <a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache Pulsar dev mailing list</a> and get documented in <a href="https://github.com/apache/pulsar/tree/master/pip#pulsar-improvement-proposal-pip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pulsar Improvement Proposals (PIPs)</a>.</p>

<p>Starting from version 3.0, users have the option to perform live upgrades or downgrades between two consecutive LTS versions or two consecutive feature versions (which also include LTS versions).</p>
<p>Pulsar changes in releases are designed in a way that allows upgrading an existing Pulsar cluster to a newer release and then rolling back to the original release version in case of issues. This is considered when changes are made in Pulsar and the default BookKeeper configuration for Pulsar. Since Apache Pulsar is an open-source project, there is no guarantee that a specific configuration can be upgraded and downgraded.</p>
<p>In many cases, the ability to downgrade won't work if the upgrade happens from an older version than the latest released version in a particular release series.
For example, upgrading to Pulsar 3.0.x works between 2.10.6 and 3.0.7, but not between 2.10.5 and 3.0.7.</p>
<p>Each Pulsar user is responsible for operating their cluster, and Pulsar cluster upgrades should be tested in testing and staging environments to ensure that a specific configuration can be upgraded and downgraded. When something is supported in the Apache Project, it means that the project is committed to addressing reported issues. This also applies to release upgrade compatibility.</p>
<p>According to this policy, users should first upgrade clusters to Pulsar 3.0.x or 3.3.x before upgrading to Pulsar 4.0.0.
If you are upgrading from Pulsar 2.x, you should first upgrade to Pulsar 2.10.6 or 2.11.3, then upgrade to Pulsar 3.0.7, and finally upgrade to Pulsar 4.0.0.</p>

<p>Older Pulsar clients are compatible with Pulsar 4.0.0 and Pulsar Java client 4.0.0 is compatible with older Pulsar clusters.
When upgrading clients, you can upgrade directly to the latest supported version. It is recommended to keep the clients up-to-date with latest security patches and bug fixes.</p>
<p>There's a critical security vulnerability <a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r7pg-v2c8-mfg3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CVE-2024-47561</a> in all Pulsar Java clients before 3.0.7, 3.3.2 and 4.0.0. Please check the <a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/security/#security-advisories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache Pulsar Security page for more details</a>. All Pulsar Java client users are recommended to upgrade to 3.0.7, 3.3.2 or 4.0.0.</p>
<p>When upgrading Java clients, it is a common problem that client module library versions are not aligned. It is recommended to use the <a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/4.0.x/client-libraries-java-setup/#pulsar-bom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pulsar BOM</a> to manage the Pulsar Java client version in Maven and Gradle builds.

<p>An increasing number of messaging-as-a-service platform teams are adopting Apache Pulsar as their main building block for providing messaging services across their organizations. This is clear validation that the value of Apache Pulsar’s truly multi-tenant architecture is delivering results, making Apache Pulsar a cost-efficient and reliable solution for messaging-as-a-service platform teams in very demanding application environments.</p>
<p>In the Apache Pulsar project, we are committed to delivering further improvements to the existing multi-tenancy features. One area of improvement is the service level management and capacity management of a large Pulsar system. This is also a key concern of messaging-as-a-service platform teams.</p>
<p>Apache Pulsar 3.2.0 features the implementation of <a href="https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pip/pip-322.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PIP-322 Pulsar Rate Limiting Refactoring</a>. Rate limiters act as a conduit to more extensive capacity management and Quality of Service (QoS) controls in Pulsar. They are integral to Pulsar's core multi-tenancy features. This refactoring paves the way for future enhancements in this area.</p>

<p>Apache Pulsar supports <a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/3.2.x/concepts-topic-compaction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Topic Compaction</a>.</p>
<p>In versions 3.1.0 and earlier of Pulsar, topic compaction retains messages that have null keys.</p>
<p>Starting with Pulsar 3.2.0, the default behavior has been changed to delete messages with null keys during topic compaction, which helps in reducing storage costs.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2023 was an incredible year for Apache Pulsar as it witnessed strong community growth, with the project becoming more stable, scalable, and secure. The Apache Pulsar community embraced a significant milestone in 2023 as the project crossed 600 contributors to the <a href="https://github.com/apache/pulsar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pulsar main GitHub repository</a>. We would like to thank everyone in the Pulsar community who contributed to this remarkable achievement!</p>
<p>Since Pulsar’s graduation as a Top-Level Project (TLP) in September 2018, it has been driven by an active global community, with <strong>12K+</strong> commits from <strong>639</strong> contributors, <strong>12.2K+</strong> stars, <strong>3.5K</strong> forks, and <strong>10K+</strong> Slack users.</p>
<p>We are grateful to all of our community members and those in the broader open-source community who contributed to the Apache Pulsar project. They are the reasons behind every step Apache Pulsar has made over the past years.</p>
<p>Now, let’s take a look at some of the highlights in 2023.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="apache-pulsar-30-lts-release-a-big-milestone-for-the-community">Apache Pulsar 3.0 LTS release: a Big Milestone for the Community<a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/blog/2024/01/12/pulsar-2023-year-in-review/#apache-pulsar-30-lts-release-a-big-milestone-for-the-community" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Apache Pulsar 3.0 LTS release: a Big Milestone for the Community" title="Direct link to Apache Pulsar 3.0 LTS release: a Big Milestone for the Community">​</a></h2>
<p>The Apache Pulsar community announced the release of Apache Pulsar 3.0, the first Long-Term Support (LTS) version! Starting from Pulsar 3.0, the Pulsar community plans to release LTS versions to meet the needs of different users for stability and new features, as well as to reduce the burden of maintaining historical releases.</p>
<p>The previous release process has short maintenance cycles of approximately 3 to 4 months, while many users are still using old versions. To keep up with new updates and features, they may be forced to perform upgrades within a short timeframe, for which they are not prepared in terms of available time and required efforts.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Pulsar community introduces LTS versions with feature releases between them. The project follows a variant of Semantic Versioning, replacing <code>major.minor.patch</code> with <code>LTS.feature.patch</code>. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>2.11.0 is a feature release</li>
<li>3.0.0 is the first LTS release</li>
<li>3.0.1 is a patch release of the LTS release</li>
<li>3.1.0 is a feature release</li>
<li>3.2.0 is a feature release</li>
<li>3.2.1 is a patch release</li>
<li>4.0.0 is an LTS release</li>
</ul>
<p>This pattern provides version support for users seeking stability and those seeking new features. Users who want a more stable release can use versions 3.0.x, while those seeking new features can use versions 3.x. This new release model is a major step for the Pulsar community because it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allows users to choose between different releases based on their needs for stability or new features;</li>
<li>Clarifies the release cycle for both maintainers and users;</li>
<li>Frees maintainers from spending too much time maintaining a long list of old releases.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the new release model, the Pulsar community looks to release LTS versions every 18 months, with bug fixes continuing for 24 months and security vulnerability patches supported for 36 months. See the image below for details.</p>

<p>In 2023, the Pulsar community worked with other open-source communities to add more integrations to the Pulsar ecosystem. Notable integrations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://quarkus.io/guides/pulsar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quarkus Extension for Apache Pulsar</a> provides support for Apache Pulsar through SmallRye Reactive Messaging framework. Based on Eclipse MicroProfile Reactive Messaging specification 3.0, it proposes a flexible programming model bridging CDI and event-driven.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://spring.io/blog/2023/11/21/spring-for-apache-pulsar-1-0-0-goes-ga/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spring for Apache Pulsar</a> provides a <code>PulsarTemplate</code> for publishing to a Pulsar topic and a <code>PulsarListener</code> annotation for consuming from a Pulsar topic, as well as various convenience APIs for Spring developers to ramp up their development journey into Apache Pulsar. Support is also included in Spring Boot via <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#messaging.pulsar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">auto-configuration</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/streamnative/oxia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oxia</a>: currently, the practical limit for the number of topics manageable by a single Pulsar cluster is around 1 million topics. The lack of horizontal scalability in Zookeeper is one of the reasons for this limit. <a href="https://github.com/streamnative/oxia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oxia</a>, released this year, is a scalable metadata store and coordination system. Replacing Zookeeper with Oxia in a Pulsar cluster allows for exceeding this 1M topics limit, although it is not the only prerequisite. This contributes to the goal of reaching 100M topics.</p>

<p>An increasing number of messaging-as-a-service platform teams are adopting Apache Pulsar as their main building block for providing messaging services across their organizations. This is clear validation that the value of Apache Pulsar’s truly multi-tenant architecture is delivering results, making Apache Pulsar a cost-efficient and reliable solution for messaging-as-a-service platform teams in very demanding application environments.</p>
<p>In the Apache Pulsar project, we are committed to delivering further improvements to the existing multi-tenancy features. One area of improvement is the service level management and capacity management of a large Pulsar system. This is also a key concern of messaging-as-a-service platform teams.</p>
<p>In December 2023, <a href="https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pip/pip-322.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PIP-322 Pulsar Rate Limiting Refactoring</a> was accepted and completed and will be release as part of Pulsar 3.2.0 release. Rate limiters act as a conduit to more extensive capacity management and Quality of Service (QoS) controls in Pulsar. They are integral to Pulsar's core multi-tenancy features. This refactoring will pave the way for future enhancements in this area.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Apache Pulsar community announces the release of Apache Pulsar 3.1, a new feature release!&nbsp;This is a remarkable community effort, with over 80 contributors submitting more than 360 commits for feature enhancements and bug fixes. We would like to thank all of them for their contributions!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-new-in-apache-pulsar-31">What's new in Apache Pulsar 3.1?<a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/blog/2023/10/10/announcing-apache-pulsar-3-1/#whats-new-in-apache-pulsar-31" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What's new in Apache Pulsar 3.1?" title="Direct link to What's new in Apache Pulsar 3.1?">​</a></h2>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="pluggable-topic-compaction-service">Pluggable topic compaction service<a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/blog/2023/10/10/announcing-apache-pulsar-3-1/#pluggable-topic-compaction-service" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Pluggable topic compaction service" title="Direct link to Pluggable topic compaction service">​</a></h3>
<p>Pulsar's <a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/3.1.x/concepts-topic-compaction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Topic Compaction</a> feature provides a key-based data retention mechanism that allows users to keep only the most recent message associated with a specific key. This helps reduce storage space and improve system efficiency.</p>
<p>Data in topics can be stored in various formats. For example, KoP (Kafka protocol handler) can store data in Kafka format.</p>
<p>Previously, Pulsar always compacted topic data, assuming that messages were in the Pulsar data format. However, this approach had limitations, as it prevented protocol handlers from utilizing the topic compaction feature with customized data formats such as the Kafka format used by KoP.</p>
<p>That's why <a href="https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/20624" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PIP-278</a> introduced a pluggable topic compaction service interface to support customization of the actual compaction logic. This customization can be done while the major compaction task is still controlled by the Pulsar broker. This change primarily benefits protocol handlers developers.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="pluggable-partition-assignment-strategy">Pluggable partition assignment strategy<a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/blog/2023/10/10/announcing-apache-pulsar-3-1/#pluggable-partition-assignment-strategy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Pluggable partition assignment strategy" title="Direct link to Pluggable partition assignment strategy">​</a></h3>
<p>Pulsar offers robust support for <a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/3.1.x/concepts-broker-load-balancing-concepts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">load balancing</a> to ensure efficient resource utilization across Pulsar clusters.</p>
<p>The fundamental unit for load balancing is the topic bundle, which refers to a group of topics within the same namespace.</p>
<p>Previously, the only strategy for assigning a topic to a topic bundle was consistent hashing. However, this strategy doesn't fit all scenarios.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/19806" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PIP-255</a> introduced a pluggable topic bundle (partition) assignment interface to allow customization of the assignment algorithm. This enables users to adjust the strategy according to their specific scenarios.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="metadata-size-threshold-for-compression">Metadata size threshold for compression<a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/blog/2023/10/10/announcing-apache-pulsar-3-1/#metadata-size-threshold-for-compression" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Metadata size threshold for compression" title="Direct link to Metadata size threshold for compression">​</a></h3>
<p>Previously, even if the metadata was small, we had to apply compression. Now, we support a size-based threshold.</p>
<p>Starting from version 2.9, Pulsar supports compressing managed ledger information and managed cursor information stored in the metadata store. This feature can significantly reduce the size of large metadata.</p>
<p>However, for small metadata, compression doesn't provide significant benefits and may consume unnecessary computational resources.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/20307" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PIP-270</a> introduces two configuration options: <code>managedLedgerInfoCompressionThresholdInBytes</code> and <code>managedCursorInfoCompressionThresholdInBytes</code>. These options allow users to customize the size threshold for compressing metadata, with the default value set to 16 KB.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lazy-creation-of-offload-resources">Lazy creation of offload resources<a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/blog/2023/10/10/announcing-apache-pulsar-3-1/#lazy-creation-of-offload-resources" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Lazy creation of offload resources" title="Direct link to Lazy creation of offload resources">​</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/3.1.x/tiered-storage-overview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tiered storage</a> is an essential technology that enables the migration of old topic data from BookKeeper to long-term and more cost-effective storage while maintaining transparent client access to the topic data.</p>
<p>Tiered storage operates through offloaders. Previously, when a topic was created, the offloader immediately generated the associated offload resources, even though these resources remained unused until the actual offloading task was triggered.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/20775" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PR-20775</a> modifies this behavior by lazily creating the offload blob store. This means that the actual allocation occurs only when the offloading task is triggered, preventing excessive preallocation of resources.</p>

<p>When upgrading an existing Pulsar installation, it's crucial to perform component upgrades in a sequential manner.</p>
<p>Starting from version 3.0, users have the option to perform live upgrades or downgrades between two consecutive LTS versions or two consecutive feature versions (which also include LTS versions).</p>
<p>For the 3.1 series, you should be able to upgrade directly from version 3.0 or downgrade from the subsequently released version 3.2. If you are currently using an earlier version, please ensure that you upgrade to version 3.0 before proceeding further.</p>

<p>Zike Yang, Software Engineer, StreamNative</p>
<p>The Apache Pulsar community recently launched <a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/blog/2023/05/02/announcing-apache-pulsar-3-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache Pulsar 3.0</a>, the first LTS release of Pulsar. In this talk, we will delve into the importance of Pulsar's LTS version. We'll also cover the major features introduced in Pulsar 3.0, including a new load balancer, support for large-scale delayed messages, and Direct IO optimization.</p>

<p>Lin Lin, SDE Expert, Huawei</p>
<p>Apache Pulsar is a cloud-native message queue that, based on its storage separation architecture, can often shrink the compute layer to save resources during periods of low traffic. We made a lot of optimizations for Apache Pulsar in containerization scenarios. For example, at present, the Pulsar load balancing algorithm relies on the past load data of nodes, and the process of achieving balance is relatively slow. When HPA is enabled, node capacity expansion may be triggered during load balancing, and capacity expansion triggers new load balancing. How can we optimize to make Pulsar more cloud-native?</p>

<p>Jialing Wang, Software development engineer, China Mobile Cloud Capability Center</p>
<p>Combined with the current limiting practice of mobile cloud Pulsar and Kafka, this speech analyzes the working principle of current limiting at all levels of production and consumption in Apache Pulsar and the implementation scheme of ResourceGroup, and introduces the mobile cloud Kafka based on Pulsar and KoP. How to manage traffic between multiple clusters in cloud native scenarios based on ResourceGroup and load balancer?</p>

<p>Yu Liu, Apache Pulsar PMC member</p>
<p>In recent years, the software industry has entered the cloud-native 2.0 era. The emergence of various new technologies has brought a sweet burden to developers. On the one hand, they have more choices; on the other hand, they face greater complexities. With the rise of the "developer-first" culture and the increasing decision-making weight of developers on product selection, the world's major technology giants are changing from traditional sales ideas to developer-centric ideas (B2D) to promote products, and high-quality content is the most effective marketing strategy. To satisfy all stakeholders' needs and accelerate the flywheel effect, how to design content that makes developers fall in love at first sight? To improve the development experience, how to create the "Aha moment" of the content? To increase user stickiness, how to make developers love the product forever through content? To strengthen brand competitiveness, how to differentiate the content strategies for open-source projects and commercial products? ——This session will share the practice in the Apache Pulsar community and dive deeper into how to design killer content that developers will love.</p>

<p>Starting from Pulsar 3.0, the Pulsar community plans to release LTS versions to meet the needs of different users for stability and new features, as well as to reduce the burden of maintaining historical releases.</p>
<p>The previous release process has short maintenance cycles of approximately 3 to 4 months, while many users are still using old versions. To keep up with new updates and features, they may be forced to perform upgrades within a short timeframe, for which they are not prepared in terms of available time and required efforts.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Pulsar community introduces LTS versions with feature releases between them. The project follows a variant of Semantic Versioning, replacing <code>major.minor.patch</code> with <code>LTS.feature.patch</code>. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>2.11.0 is a feature release;</li>
<li>3.0.0 is the first LTS release;</li>
<li>3.0.1 is a patch release of the LTS release;</li>
<li>3.1.0 is a feature release;</li>
<li>3.2.0 is a feature release;</li>
<li>3.2.1 is a patch release;</li>
<li>4.0.0 is an LTS release.</li>
</ul>
<p>This pattern provides version support for users seeking stability and those seeking new features. Users who want a more stable release can use versions 3.0.x, while those seeking new features can use versions 3.x. This new release model is a major step for the Pulsar community because it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allows users to choose between different releases based on their needs for stability or new features;</li>
<li>Clarifies the release cycle for both maintainers and users;</li>
<li>Frees maintainers from spending too much time maintaining a long list of old releases.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the new release model, the Pulsar community looks to release LTS versions every 18 months, with bug fixes continuing for 24 months and security vulnerability patches supported for 36 months. See the image below for details.</p>

<p>Apache Pulsar 3.0 is an LTS release with a number of important features, enhancements, and fixes. Here are some of the highlighted ones.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="new-pulsar-broker-load-balancer">New Pulsar broker load balancer<a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/blog/2023/05/02/announcing-apache-pulsar-3-0/#new-pulsar-broker-load-balancer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to New Pulsar broker load balancer" title="Direct link to New Pulsar broker load balancer">​</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/16691" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PIP-192</a> introduces a new load manager implementation, aiming to balance cluster utilization as evenly as possible while minimizing latency and reducing reliance on ZooKeeper.</p>
<p>Issues with the previous load manager include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Load data for all brokers and bundles is replicated to all brokers via ZK watchers. This N-replication poses scalability issues when Pulsar clusters grow to thousands of brokers and millions of topics.</li>
<li>Lookup requires redirection to the leader broker.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Pulsar 3.0, the broker and bundle load data have been re-evaluated. The new load manager stores this load data in non-persistent topics, while topic ownership information is saved in system topics and maintained with a state machine for eventual consistency. Clients can now connect to any broker for lookup without redirection.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="large-scale-delayed-message-support">Large-scale delayed message support<a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/blog/2023/05/02/announcing-apache-pulsar-3-0/#large-scale-delayed-message-support" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Large-scale delayed message support" title="Direct link to Large-scale delayed message support">​</a></h3>
<p>Scheduled and delayed message delivery is a common feature in messaging systems. <a href="https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/16763" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PIP-195</a> aims to address limitations in this feature, which has been supported since version 2.4.0. The issues with the current implementation include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Memory constraints: The delayed message index is typically maintained in memory, leading to high memory overhead when there are many delayed messages. Although it is possible to utilize multiple brokers’ memory by creating multiple partitions for a topic and distributing them across multiple brokers, the overall memory consumption remains unchanged.</li>
<li>Expensive index rebuilding: In the case of a large number of delayed messages (e.g. hundreds of millions), when migrating a topic to a different broker or recovering from broker downtime, rebuilding the index requires replaying logs. This process consumes significant resources and affects both the client and catch-up reads.</li>
</ul>
<p>The objectives of the new delayed message mechanism introduced in Pulsar 3.0 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supporting delayed message index snapshots to minimize the costs of rebuilding the index;</li>
<li>Reducing memory usage for maintaining the delayed message index.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="build-multi-arch-docker-images">Build multi-arch docker images<a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/blog/2023/05/02/announcing-apache-pulsar-3-0/#build-multi-arch-docker-images" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Build multi-arch docker images" title="Direct link to Build multi-arch docker images">​</a></h3>
<p>With 3.0, Pulsar will start publishing Docker images with versions both for Intel x86-64 and Arm64 architectures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users trying to use Pulsar standalone, or running TestContainer tests on a Mac M1/M2 laptop will now see much improved performance and avoid all the issues with the Docker container engine when it emulates x86-64 CPU withing an Arm64 host.</p>
<p>At the same time, this image will make it possible to run Pulsar in a Docker/Kubernetes production environment on Arm64 machines.</p>
<p>From a user perspective, no change is required: when pulling the image, Docker will select the appropriate version based on the host architecture.</p>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bookkeeper-direct-io-logic-optimization">BookKeeper direct IO logic optimization<a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/blog/2023/05/02/announcing-apache-pulsar-3-0/#bookkeeper-direct-io-logic-optimization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to BookKeeper direct IO logic optimization" title="Direct link to BookKeeper direct IO logic optimization">​</a></h3>
<p>The current ledger read/write logic in BookKeeper involves multiple buffering and caching layers, which cause limitations in read and write throughput due to memory consumption, inefficient cache utilization, and eviction problems.</p>
<p>More specifically, when writing an entry, data is buffered in both the memory table and the OS PageCache (after the memory table is full). When reading an entry, data may be fetched from the memory table, read cache, or read from the entry log file based on cache hits, potentially causing memory waste and reduced cache hit rate. Since the OS PageCache is shared by all read and write files, and the OS will prefetch a fixed amount of data when reading files, it is easy to cause OS PageCache pollution and affect the read and write performance.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/issues/2943#issuecomment-1086446251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BP-47</a> introduces optional support to bypass the OS PageCache using the O_DIRECT flag for <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open(2)</a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fallocate.2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fallocate(2)</a> syscalls on supported systems (Linux and macOS). The new implementation uses JNI for direct I/O and incorporates write buffer pools and read buffer management. It helps reduce memory consumption and achieve better control over cache utilization. It modifies the existing ledger read/write logic while maintaining the original organization of the entry log file.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="transaction-buffer-segmented-snapshot-optimization">Transaction Buffer segmented snapshot optimization<a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/blog/2023/05/02/announcing-apache-pulsar-3-0/#transaction-buffer-segmented-snapshot-optimization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Transaction Buffer segmented snapshot optimization" title="Direct link to Transaction Buffer segmented snapshot optimization">​</a></h3>
<p>The current Transaction Buffer in Pulsar involves handling messages sent with transactions and taking periodic snapshots to avoid replaying all messages from the original topic. However, when a topic has long-term data retention and many aborted transactions, a snapshot may become a bottleneck, causing increased costs as the snapshot size grows.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/16913" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PIP-196</a> introduces a segmented transaction buffer snapshot, which allows splitting the snapshot into multiple parts, each with a fixed number of aborted transactions and a maxReadPosition identity. This approach aims to support a large number of aborted transactions, improve transaction buffer recovery speed, and address the write amplification issue in system topic snapshots.</p>
<p>In Pulsar 3.0, the new design incorporates multiple snapshot segments through a secondary index, with index and snapshot segments stored in different compact topics. The snapshot segment is an immutable segment that can be configured in size. A new system topic is used to store snapshot segments, while a separate index topic stores the snapshot segment indexes, allowing for more efficient recovery and reduced memory overhead.</p>
<p>The proposal modifies the existing transaction buffer logic while maintaining the original organization of the transaction buffer, with the goal of improving overall performance and resource utilization.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="blue-green-cluster-deployment-support">Blue-green cluster deployment support<a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/blog/2023/05/02/announcing-apache-pulsar-3-0/#blue-green-cluster-deployment-support" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Blue-green cluster deployment support" title="Direct link to Blue-green cluster deployment support">​</a></h3>
<p>Blue-green deployment is a widely-used solution for migrating live traffic from one cluster to another. In this model, traffic is gradually transferred from the blue cluster to the green cluster, allowing for smooth upgrades and the possibility of rollbacks if necessary.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/16551" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PIP-188</a> implements blue-green deployment in Pulsar by introducing changes to the broker, client, and managedLedger. The broker will support an admin API that allows marking a cluster for migration and specifying redirection URLs. The migration state and redirection URLs are persisted in the cluster metadata. The broker asynchronously marks each topic owned by that broker as migrated and notifies all the producers and consumers (which have drained the backlog for their subscriptions) with a new client-protocol command called “Migrated-Topic”, which has redirection URLs to the green cluster. Producers and consumers for those topics cache the redirection URLs and retry to connect to the broker with that URL which redirects them to the green cluster.</p>
<p>With such capability introduced in Pulsar 3.0, users can achieve seamless traffic migration between clusters without causing downtime for topics.</p>

<p>When upgrading an existing Pulsar version, it is important to upgrade components linearly.</p>
<p>Before Pulsar 3.0, upgrades should be performed linearly through each feature version. For example, when upgrading from 2.8 to 2.10, it is important to upgrade to 2.9 before going to 2.10.</p>
<p>Starting from 3.0, users can perform live upgrades or downgrades between two consecutive LTS versions. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ 3.0 -&gt; 4.0 -&gt; 3.0;</li>
<li>✅ 3.2 -&gt; 4.0 -&gt; 3.2;</li>
<li>✅ 3.2 -&gt; 4.4 -&gt; 3.2;</li>
<li>❌ 3.2 -&gt; 5.0.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pulsar 3.0.0 is now available for download on GitHub. To get started with Pulsar, you can run a Pulsar cluster <a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/3.0.x/getting-started-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on your local machine, Docker, or Kubernetes</a>.</p>

<p>With Pulsar 3.0 LTS model, it will be easier for users to choose to stay on LTS stable releases or newer releases with the latest feature and improvements, all with the guarantee of longer support and a path to a live upgrade to the next LTS version.</p>
<p>At the same time, several features introduced in 3.0 sets the stage for further improvements. One such example is the new load balancer (PIP-192): while immediately useful and a marked improvement as it is, it also paves the way for many more optimizations in how topics are transferred from one broker to another, with the goal of minimizing the latency impact of such operations.</p>
<p>Another exciting area of development is the proposal to rehaul the metric collection and aggregation system described in <a href="https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/20197" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PIP-264</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, Pulsar 3.0 is benefitting from the performance improvements introduced in Apache BookKeeper 4.16. We see a lot of potential to further improve BookKeeper performance for an even faster Pulsar!</p>

<p>In earlier versions, when the broker was shutting down, the <code>AbstractBatchedMetadataStore</code> would complete pending operations with a generic <code>IllegalStateException</code>. However, code dependent on the <code>MetadataStore</code> usually expected instances of <code>MetadataStoreException</code> and might not react properly to this error.</p>

<p>This PR improves the error handling during broker shutdown by completing pending operations with an <code>AlreadyClosedException</code> instead of <code>IllegalStateException</code>. This ensures that the dependent code responds more appropriately to the error, even if the broker is shutting down.</p>

<p>The Apache Pulsar community embraced a significant milestone last month as the project witnessed its 600th contributor to the <a href="https://github.com/apache/pulsar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pulsar main GitHub repository</a>. We would like to thank everyone in the Pulsar community who contributed to this remarkable achievement.</p>
<p>Since Pulsar’s graduation as a Top-Level Project (TLP) in September 2018, it has been driven by an active global community, with <strong>160+</strong> releases, <strong>11K+</strong> commits from <strong>600</strong> contributors, <strong>12.2K+</strong> stars, <strong>3.2K+</strong> forks, and <strong>9600+</strong> Slack users.</p>

<p>The number of contributors is an important metric to measure the health of an open-source project. In the last year alone, we added almost 130 contributors to the project, a 28% increase from the previous year. The image below shows the number of Pulsar contributors over the past 6 years.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://pulsar.apache.org/assets/images/pulsar-total-contributors-202301-692173316eb587e43f81f15d899537e2.jpg" width="843" height="550" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p><strong>Issue</strong></p>
<p>Synchronizing configuration metadata (policies) is a critical path to sharing tenant/namespace/topic policies among clusters and administering policies uniformly across all clusters. However, syncing the metadata store (global zookeeper) among Pulsar clusters deployed on separate cloud platforms is not supported in earlier versions.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong></p>
<p>Use two system topics <code>metadataSyncEventTopic</code> and <code>configurationmetadataSyncEventTopic</code> along with a metadata synchronizer to sync metadata among clusters deployed on different cloud platforms and persist local topic policies with it.</p>

<p><strong>Issue</strong></p>
<p>In earlier versions, if you want to dynamically set an output topic, message properties, or change the output schema in a Pulsar function, the only way is to create a function that returns <code>Void</code>. It would be more intuitive to return a structure like <code>Record</code> that carries this information.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong></p>
<p>Add a utility method <code>newOutputRecordBuilder</code> to <code>Context</code> that returns a <code>FunctionRecord</code> builder initialized with the information from the source record. The builder methods can be used to override these values as needed.</p>

<p><strong>Issue</strong></p>
<p>Pulsar supports cloud storage compatible with S3 APIs, such as AWS and Aliyun, through existing offloaders, but the forced registration of specific metadata limits their use.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong></p>
<p>Provide a more general offloader <code>S3</code> to serve more S3-compatible storage, which uses pure JClouds S3 metadata and allows overriding the default JClouds properties through system properties.</p>

<p>In earlier versions, delayed message delivery and transaction messages could not be used simultaneously.

<p>When detecting that all messages have a fixed delay time, it’s helpful that users can configure the size of <code>lookahead</code> to detect and pause the reads from cursors. But in earlier versions, the size of `lookahead is pre-defined and fixed, which lacks flexibility and limits the usage.</p>

<p>In earlier versions, <code>BlockAwareSegmentInputStreamImpl</code> never releases the BookKeeper entries in the <code>close</code> method, leading to <code>OutOfDirectMemory</code> errors on brokers that frequently run offloading activities.

<p>In earlier versions, when you delete a namespace by force, if <code>__transaction_buffer_snapshot</code> and <code>__change_events</code> (system topic for topic policies) have been deleted, then the deletion of regular topics will fail because it cannot clear the snapshots and topic policies.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="resolution-3">Resolution<a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/blog/2023/01/09/Apache-Pulsar-2-10-3/#resolution-3" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Resolution" title="Direct link to Resolution">​</a></h4>
<p>Delete regular topics before deleting system topics when deleting a namespace. And deleting the system topic <code>__change_events</code> does not clear its topic policy.</p>

<p>Jason Jiang, Senior Engineer, Tencent</p>
<p>In game marketing, the OTO (One-time Offer) model provides an effective way to improve user experience. A very common OTO scenario is to recommend certain material when the player has met the required conditions. To offer such a capability with low cost and high efficiency, you can use a customized Envoy plugin to support the Pulsar protocol. With Envoy’s flexible routing configurations and various functional plugins, you can provide solutions to different OTO business scenarios with microservices. In this session, Jason Jiang from Tencent will share their experience of using Pulsar and Envoy to create an OTO marketing platform built on microservices for different business scenarios.</p>

<p>The compaction reader seeks the earliest position to read data from the topic, but the compaction properties are missed during cursor reset, which leads to the initialized compaction subscribe without a compaction horizon, so the compaction reader skips the last compacted data.

<p>Keep the properties for resetting the cursor while the cursor is for data compaction.
Copy the properties to the new mark delete entry while advancing the cursor, which is triggered by the managed ledger internal. It's not only for the compacted topic, and the internal task should not lose the properties when trimming the cursor.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Apache Pulsar community releases version 2.9.3! 50 contributors provided improvements and bug fixes that delivered 200+ commits. Thanks for all your contributions.</p>
<p>The highlight of the 2.9.3 release is introducing 30+ transaction fixes and improvements. Earlier-adoption users of Pulsar transactions have documented long-term use in their production environments and reported valuable findings in real applications. This provides the Pulsar community with the opportunity to make a difference.</p>
<p>This blog walks through the most noteworthy changes. For the complete list including all feature enhancements and bug fixes, check out the <a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/release-notes/versioned/pulsar-2.9.3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pulsar 2.9.3 Release Notes</a>.</p>

<p>The cursor data is managed by the ZooKeeper/Etcd metadata store. When the data size increases, it may take too much time to pull the data, and brokers may end up writing large chunks of data to the ZooKeeper/Etcd metadata store.</p>

<p>The map <code>metadataPositions</code> in MLPendingAckStore is used to clear useless data in PendingAck, where the key is the position that is persistent in PendingAck and the value is the max position acked by an operation. It judges whether the max subscription cursor position is smaller than the subscription cursor’s <code>markDeletePosition</code>. If the max position is smaller, then the log cursor will mark to delete the position. It causes two main issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>In normal cases, this map stores all transaction ack operations. This is a waste of memory and CPU.</li>
<li>If a transaction that has not been committed for a long time acks a message in a later position, the map will not be cleaned up, which finally leads to OOM (out-of-memory).</li>
</ul>

<p>This performance regression was introduced in 2.10.0, 2.9.1, and 2.8.3. You may find a significant performance drop with message listeners while using Java Client. The root cause is each message will introduce the thread switching from the external thread pool to the internal thread poll and then to the external thread pool.</p>

<p>This deadlock issue occurred during topic creation by trying to re-acquire the same <code>StampedLock</code> from the same thread when removing it.

<p>Pulsar has some internal data structures, such as <code>ConcurrentLongLongPairHashMap</code>, and <code>ConcurrentLongPairHashMap</code>, which can reduce the memory usage rather than using the Boxing type. However, in earlier versions, the data structures were not supported for shrinking even if the data was removed, which wasted a certain amount of memory in certain situations.</p>

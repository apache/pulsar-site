The Shared Subscription supports distributing messages out-of-order across many consumers, while individual acknowledgment enables a consumer to mark a specific message as done.</p><p>This feature is amplified by Pulsar's ability to scale horizontally, most notably: do it rapidly, since its design avoids data reshuffling, making newly created nodes available immediately to handle the load.</p>",smallText:"There are common use cases in many companies requiring task queue systems that enable submitting a task to run and ensuring it\u2019s executed, including error handling.",docsLink:"cookbooks-message-queue/",caseLink:!1},{icon:"arrow",title:"Scalable RPC",text:"<p>In a micro-services architecture, there is a need to communicate between services constantly.

Below you can review common use cases for the [broker load balancer](./concepts-broker-load-balancing-overview.md). 

## Spread workloads for scaling

The broker load balancer routes incoming data processing requests to available brokers for stable performance, making it ideal for quick horizontal scaling â€” whether in response to sudden traffic spikes or deliberate business expansions. In this case, you can run high-traffic applications with a lot of concurrent data requests in a fast and reliable manner. 

## High availability with fault tolerance

The broker load balancer can increase cluster availability by re-routing data loads to other available brokers if a broker fails. This failover mechanism ensures the availability of the whole system.

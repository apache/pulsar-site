I‚Äôm really surprised at how much content they are giving you, and the features such as on demand that essentially rival your cable. My wife won‚Äôt let me cancel the cable, and Comcast already gives me all the features that this includes, as well as many that it does not‚Ä¶ however that doesn‚Äôt diminish the quantity and quality of the content that they are giving you here. Essentially, only for the inconvenience of forcing notifications to be ‚Äúon‚Äù 24-7 for this app, which is annoying, very annoying, but in many cases it alerts me of breaking news that I otherwise would be completely in the dark over, or would not know about it for another few hours to few days. In any case it‚Äôs worth the download, and the time to check it out. more Developer Response , Hello, thank you for taking the time out to leave us such a great review! We are very excited to see you enjoy the selection and the features we offer. We can also see why you find notifications bothersome, and are sorry for the inconvenience caused. To disable some of the notifications, please go to Notification Settings on My TV App tab, where customized options are offered. We hope this helps improve your experience. If you have any other questions or suggestions, feel free to send them to freetvapp.question@gmail.com. We‚Äôd love to hear from you again! more Tita Teresita , 02/10/2021 Annoying to try to watch Sometimes there is a heading of an email from this app that comes across the top of my phone that interests me but each time I try to read something about your email that I just read I end up regretting even trying. I get stuck in that cycle of going in circles it seems. As I select something on the screen it‚Äôll take me somewhere else and sometimes I get tricked into thinking I‚Äôm selecting the right place to touch on my phone screen but it actually is taking me to something I never wanted to read. Then the place I was originally trying to get to read the article that got my attention is then lost. To top it off then while I‚Äôm trying to backtrack to find the article I get something like this right here saying that if I could rate them 5 stars it helps. That every 5star rating helps. Well what is it that I‚Äôm helping? Why should I rate something 5 stars when I‚Äôm stuck in the middle of an online Tornado of unwanted information that did nothing but frustrate me and waste a lot of my time that I end up getting more upset about because now I‚Äôm late to what I was supposed to be doing today. So there you go, here‚Äôs your rating from me, a person you‚Äôve really frustrated once again unfortunately! more Developer Response , Hi, we are very sorry to hear about your negative experience with our app. It would seem that you are referring to our Notification on my tablet Devices Website Business Customer service robot retailer purchase products on   https://auth-web.moviesanywhere.com?moviesanywhere-Video-films-live-Streaming-Production-Broadcasting-auth-web.moviesanywhere+DTS-+Toshiba-Fire+TV-entertainment-Network-Toshiba+fire-tv+Connected+On-live-Streams+BlackStarz.ai<ai:\><a href="https%3A%2F%2Fauth-web.moviesanywhere.com%2Fauth%2Fgoogle%3Fsuccess%3Dtrue%26id_token%3Deyjhbgcioijsuzi1niisimtpzci6imvkmzzjmju3yzq3zwjhymi0n2i0nty4mjhhodu4ywe1zmnkyteyzgqilcj0exaioijkv1qifq.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.wsqspqfqee1ffvul4qwkwsxk8doqcnr5vshnv0x3farkk2aqjqjp5kcyqqodwzxolmcn0hg5_ja0czbfwndnu5kd06lbie-jhvpom4qfcz28j7gh6q9ggh67lt6zszvjy6bfduyzenvdknznvdw5qrjwkq1j-ciqeg5jbnekgju2gwzs9qd3o69-qxbnt7qptqup5f6ykmf6wxo6ylns6muwzvahycbaklzyqqllj8frk1iriftiv9liifbclitqjx4afsxzqbn6fcwkhvmn5-d9rxcrshq3siwvqyl4lofhonl3xzd25uph3hmgp0zw_pet4xuq415o9cj-qhzlja&oq=&aqs=chrome.1.35i39i362l8j46i39i199i362i465j35i39i362l5j46i39i199i362i465.-1j0j7&client=tablet-android-digiland&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8+website/Jarvis-ai-tools-kit-box-Internet-engines.yml/You are receiving LinkedIn notification emails.

Messaging systems are most powerful when you can easily use them with external systems like databases and other messaging systems.

**Pulsar IO connectors** enable you to easily create, deploy, and manage connectors that interact with external systems, such as [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org), [Aerospike](https://www.aerospike.com), and many others.


## Concept

Pulsar IO connectors come in two types: **source** and **sink**.

This diagram illustrates the relationship between source, Pulsar, and sink:

![Pulsar IO diagram](/assets/pulsar-io.png "Pulsar IO connectors (sources and sinks)")


### Source

> Sources **feed data from external systems into Pulsar**.

Common sources include other messaging systems and firehose-style data pipeline APIs.

For the complete list of Pulsar built-in source connectors, see [source connector](io-connectors.md#source-connector).

### Sink

> Sinks **feed data from Pulsar into external systems**.

Common sinks include other messaging systems and SQL and NoSQL databases.

For the complete list of Pulsar built-in sink connectors, see [sink connector](io-connectors.md#sink-connector).

## Processing guarantee

Processing guarantees are used to handle errors when writing messages to Pulsar topics.
  
> Pulsar connectors and Functions use the **same** processing guarantees as below.

Delivery semantic | Description
:------------------|:-------
`at-most-once` | Each message sent to a connector is to be **processed once** or **not to be processed**.
`at-least-once`  | Each message sent to a connector is to be **processed once** or **more than once**.
`effectively-once` | Each message sent to a connector has **one output associated** with it.

> Processing guarantees for connectors not just rely on Pulsar guarantee but also **relate to external systems**, that is, **the implementation of source and sink**.

* Source: Pulsar ensures that writing messages to Pulsar topics respects the processing guarantees. It is within Pulsar's control.

* Sink: the processing guarantees rely on the sink implementation. If the sink implementation does not handle retries in an idempotent way, the sink does not respect the processing guarantees.

### Set

When creating a connector, you can set the processing guarantee with the following semantics:

* ATLEAST_ONCE
  
* ATMOST_ONCE
  
* EFFECTIVELY_ONCE

> If `--processing-guarantees` is not specified when creating a connector, the default semantic is `ATLEAST_ONCE`.

Take **Admin CLI** as an example. For more information about **REST API** or **JAVA Admin API**, see [here](io-use.md#create).

</TabItem>

### Update 

After creating a connector, you can update the processing guarantee with the following semantics:

* ATLEAST_ONCE
  
* ATMOST_ONCE
  
* EFFECTIVELY_ONCE
  
Take **Admin CLI** as an example. For more information about **REST API** or **JAVA Admin API**, see [here](io-use.md#create).

    # Other sink configs
```

## Work with connector

You can manage Pulsar connectors (for example, create, update, start, stop, restart, reload, delete and perform other operations on connectors) via the `Connector Admin CLI` with sources and sinks subcommands. For the latest and complete information, see [Pulsar admin docs](/tools/pulsar-admin/).

Connectors (sources and sinks) and Functions are components of instances, and they all run on Functions workers. When managing a source, sink or function via the `Connector Admin CLI` or `Functions Admin CLI`, an instance is started on a worker. For more information, see [Functions worker](functions-worker.md).

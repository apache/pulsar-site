Pulsar admin APIs are one of the best productivity tools. You can perform various tasks with them, for example:

- Administering Pulsar instances easily by creating, updating, or deleting objects with a single line of command, which increases management efficiency.

- Monitoring Pulsar or troubleshooting issues by getting the status and information about Pulsar clusters, which reduces maintenance costs.

- Facilitating the workflow of application development by implementing admin interface clients using your preferred languages (e.g., Go, Python, C++) based on REST APIs, which enhances developer experiences.

Pulsar supports a pluggable [authentication](security-overview.md) mechanism which can be configured at the proxy and/or the broker. Pulsar also supports a pluggable [authorization](security-authorization.md) mechanism. These mechanisms work together to identify the client and its access rights on topics, namespaces and tenants.

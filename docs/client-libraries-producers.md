After setting up your clients, you can explore more to start working with [producers](concepts-clients.md#producers).

## Publish messages to partitioned topics

By default, Pulsar topics are served by a single broker, which limits the maximum throughput of a topic. *Partitioned topics* can span multiple brokers and thus allow for higher throughput.

You can publish messages to partitioned topics using Pulsar client libraries. When publishing messages to partitioned topics, you must specify a routing mode. If you do not specify any routing mode when you create a new producer, the round-robin routing mode is used.

#### Routing mode

You can specify the routing mode in the `ProducerConfiguration` object used to configure your producer. The routing mode determines which partition (internal topic) each message should be published to.

The following {@inject: javadoc:MessageRoutingMode:/client/org/apache/pulsar/client/api/MessageRoutingMode} options are available.

Mode     | Description
:--------|:------------
`RoundRobinPartition` | If no key is provided, the producer publishes messages across all partitions in the round-robin policy to achieve the maximum throughput. Round-robin is not done per individual message. It is set to the same boundary of batching delay to ensure that batching is effective. If a key is specified on the message, the partitioned producer hashes the key and assigns the message to a particular partition. This is the default mode.
`SinglePartition`     | If no key is provided, the producer picks a single partition randomly and publishes all messages into that partition. If a key is specified on the message, the partitioned producer hashes the key and assigns the message to a particular partition.
`CustomPartition`     | Use custom message router implementation that is called to determine the partition for a particular message. You can create a custom routing mode by using the Java client and implementing the {@inject: javadoc:MessageRouter:/client/org/apache/pulsar/client/api/MessageRouter} interface.

The following is an example:

```java
String pulsarBrokerRootUrl = "pulsar://localhost:6650";
String topic = "persistent://my-tenant/my-namespace/my-topic";

PulsarClient pulsarClient = PulsarClient.builder().serviceUrl(pulsarBrokerRootUrl).build();
Producer<byte[]> producer = pulsarClient.newProducer()
        .topic(topic)
        .messageRoutingMode(MessageRoutingMode.SinglePartition)
        .create();
producer.send("Partitioned topic message".getBytes());
```

#### Custom message router

To use a custom message router, you need to provide an implementation of the {@inject: javadoc:MessageRouter:/client/org/apache/pulsar/client/api/MessageRouter} interface, which has just one `choosePartition` method:

```java
public interface MessageRouter extends Serializable {
    int choosePartition(Message msg);
}
```

The following router routes every message to partition 10:

```java
public class AlwaysTenRouter implements MessageRouter {
    public int choosePartition(Message msg) {
        return 10;
    }
}
```

With that implementation, you can send messages to partitioned topics as below.

```java
String pulsarBrokerRootUrl = "pulsar://localhost:6650";
String topic = "persistent://my-tenant/my-cluster-my-namespace/my-topic";

PulsarClient pulsarClient = PulsarClient.builder().serviceUrl(pulsarBrokerRootUrl).build();
Producer<byte[]> producer = pulsarClient.newProducer()
        .topic(topic)
        .messageRouter(new AlwaysTenRouter())
        .create();
producer.send("Partitioned topic message".getBytes());
```

#### Choose partitions when using a key

If a message has a key, it supersedes the round robin routing policy. The following example illustrates how to choose the partition when using a key.

```java
// If the message has a key, it supersedes the round robin routing policy
        if (msg.hasKey()) {
            return signSafeMod(hash.makeHash(msg.getKey()), topicMetadata.numPartitions());
        }

        if (isBatchingEnabled) { // if batching is enabled, choose partition on `partitionSwitchMs` boundary.
            long currentMs = clock.millis();
            return signSafeMod(currentMs / partitionSwitchMs + startPtnIdx, topicMetadata.numPartitions());
        } else {
            return signSafeMod(PARTITION_INDEX_UPDATER.getAndIncrement(this), topicMetadata.numPartitions());
        }
```

## Async send messages

You can publish messages [asynchronously](concepts-clients.md#send-modes) using the Java client. With async send, the producer puts the message in a blocking queue and returns it immediately. Then the client library sends the message to the broker in the background. If the queue is full (max size configurable), the producer is blocked or fails immediately when calling the API, depending on arguments passed to the producer.

The following is an example.

```java
producer.sendAsync("my-async-message".getBytes()).thenAccept(msgId -> {
    System.out.println("Message with ID " + msgId + " successfully sent");
});
```

As you can see from the example above, async send operations return a {@inject: javadoc:MessageId:/client/org/apache/pulsar/client/api/MessageId} wrapped in a [`CompletableFuture`](http://www.baeldung.com/java-completablefuture).

## Configure messages

In addition to a value, you can set additional items on a given message:

```java
producer.newMessage()
    .key("my-message-key")
    .value("my-async-message".getBytes())
    .property("my-key", "my-value")
    .property("my-other-key", "my-other-value")
    .send();
```

You can terminate the builder chain with `sendAsync()` and get a future return.

## Enable chunking

Message [chunking](concepts-messaging.md#chunking) enables Pulsar to process large payload messages by splitting the message into chunks at the producer side and aggregating chunked messages on the consumer side. 

The message chunking feature is OFF by default. The following is an example of how to enable message chunking when creating a producer.

````mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="lang-choice"
  defaultValue="Java"
  values={[{"label":"Java","value":"Java"},{"label":"Python","value":"Python"},{"label":"C++","value":"C++"},{"label":"Go","value":"Go"}]}>
<TabItem value="Java">

   ```java
     Producer<byte[]> producer = client.newProducer()
        .topic(topic)
        .enableChunking(true)
        .enableBatching(false)
        .create();
   ```
   
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="C++">

   ```cpp
   ProducerConfiguration conf;
   conf.setBatchingEnabled(false);
   conf.setChunkingEnabled(true);
   Producer producer;
   client.createProducer("my-topic", conf, producer);
   ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
````

By default, producer chunks the large message based on max message size (`maxMessageSize`) configured at broker (eg: 5MB). However, client can also configure max chunked size using producer configuration `chunkMaxMessageSize`.

:::note

To enable chunking, you need to disable batching (`enableBatching`=`false`) concurrently.

## Intercept messages

`ProducerInterceptor` intercepts and possibly mutates messages received by the producer before they are published to the brokers.

The interface has three main events:
* `eligible` checks if the interceptor can be applied to the message.
* `beforeSend` is triggered before the producer sends the message to the broker. You can modify messages within this event.
* `onSendAcknowledgement` is triggered when the message is acknowledged by the broker or the sending failed.

To intercept messages, you can add a `ProducerInterceptor` or multiple ones when creating a `Producer` as follows.

```java
Producer<byte[]> producer = client.newProducer()
        .topic(topic)
        .intercept(new ProducerInterceptor {
			@Override
			boolean eligible(Message message) {
			    return true;  // process all messages
			}

			@Override
			Message beforeSend(Producer producer, Message message) {
			    // user-defined processing logic
			}

			@Override
			void onSendAcknowledgement(Producer producer, Message message, MessageId msgId, Throwable exception) {
			    // user-defined processing logic
			}
        })
        .create();
```

:::note

Multiple interceptors apply in the order they are passed to the `intercept` method.

# Pulsar C++ Client Generated Docs

Pulsar C++ client uses [`doxygen`](https://doxygen.nl/) to generate API docs.

When starting in the root directory of the `pulsar-site` project, you can run:

```shell
./site2/tools/apidoc/cpp/doxygen-generator.py <VERSION>
```

... where the `VERSION` is released semantic version like `2.10.2` or `3.0.0`.

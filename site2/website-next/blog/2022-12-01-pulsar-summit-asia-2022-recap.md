Before we talk	about some of the Summit highlights, we would like to thank the entire Apache Pulsar community and all the friends from other open-source communities for making this event a great success! Additionally, this event would not have drawn the attention of such a broad audience without our speakers, Program Committee members, as well as community and media partners. Thank you all for your help and energy!

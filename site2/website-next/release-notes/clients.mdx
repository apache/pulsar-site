The code repos of Java and WebSocket clients are hosted in the [Pulsar main repo](https://github.com/apache/pulsar). These clients are released simultaneously with Pulsar.

The code repos of [C++](https://github.com/apache/pulsar-client-cpp), [Python](https://github.com/apache/pulsar-client-python), [Go](https://github.com/apache/pulsar-client-go), [Node.js](https://github.com/apache/pulsar-client-node), and [C#](https://github.com/apache/pulsar-dotpulsar) clients are hosted outside the Pulsar main repo. These clients are released independently with Pulsar.

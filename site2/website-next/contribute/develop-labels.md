This guide explains the labels used in the [apache/pulsar](http://github.com/apache/pulsar) repository (the main repo).

## ready-to-test

After [PR-17693](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/17693) merged, pull requests should be first tested in your own fork since the pulsar CI based on GitHub Actions has constrained resources and quota. GitHub Actions provides separate quota for pull requests that are executed in a forked repository.

When a committer believe the PR is ready to test, they will label `ready-to-test` to the PR, and then you can rerun the CI tasks by commenting `/pulsarbot run-failure-checks` and trigger the full CI validation.

See also [CI Testing in Fork](testing-and-ci/personal-ci.md).

## doc-*

When submitting an issue or PR, you must [choose one of the documentation checkboxes](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md#documentation), so the automation can label the PR correctly.

| Label               | Usage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

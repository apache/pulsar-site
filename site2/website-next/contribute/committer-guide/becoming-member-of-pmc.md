The project management committee (PMC) is the project governance body. Committers or contributors that have demonstrated continued involvement with the community can be nominated to become members of the PMC.

PMC members nominate new contributors to the project as either committers or as new PMC members, and PMC members cast votes on electing new committers or PMC members to the project. PMC members also have binding votes on any project matters. Refer to [ASF PMCs governance](http://www.apache.org/foundation/governance/pmcs.html) for a more detailed explanation of the duties and roles of the PMC.

# CVE-2023-37544: Apache Pulsar WebSocket Proxy: Improper Authentication for WebSocket Proxy Endpoint Allows DoS 

## Affected versions:

- Apache Pulsar WebSocket Proxy 2.8.0 through 2.8.*
- Apache Pulsar WebSocket Proxy 2.9.0 through 2.9.*
- Apache Pulsar WebSocket Proxy 2.10.0 through 2.10.4
- Apache Pulsar WebSocket Proxy 2.11.0 through 2.11.1

## Description:

Improper Authentication vulnerability in Apache Pulsar WebSocket Proxy allows an attacker to connect to the /pingpong endpoint without authentication.

2.11 Pulsar WebSocket Proxy users should upgrade to at least 2.11.2.<br/>
3.0 Pulsar WebSocket Proxy users should upgrade to at least 3.0.1.<br/>

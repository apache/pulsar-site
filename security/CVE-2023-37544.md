# CVE-2023-37544: Apache Pulsar WebSocket Proxy: Improper Authentication for WebSocket Proxy Endpoint Allows DoS 

## Affected versions:

- Apache Pulsar WebSocket Proxy 2.8.0 through 2.8.*
- Apache Pulsar WebSocket Proxy 2.9.0 through 2.9.*
- Apache Pulsar WebSocket Proxy 2.10.0 through 2.10.4
- Apache Pulsar WebSocket Proxy 2.11.0 through 2.11.1
- Apache Pulsar WebSocket Proxy 3.0.0

## Description:

Improper Authentication vulnerability in Apache Pulsar WebSocket Proxy allows an attacker to connect to the /pingpong endpoint without authentication.

2.11 Pulsar WebSocket Proxy users should upgrade to at least 2.11.2.\
3.0 Pulsar WebSocket Proxy users should upgrade to at least 3.0.1.\
3.1 Pulsar WebSocket Proxy users are unaffected.\

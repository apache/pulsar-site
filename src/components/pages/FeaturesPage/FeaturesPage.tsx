          Apache Pulsar server - the Broker - does not persist a received message to a file on the local disk. Instead, it writes the message to another system called <a target='_blank' href='https://bookkeeper.apache.org/'>Apache Bookkeeper </a> - which can be shortly described as a distributed (multiple nodes) append-only virtual-file storage. The message is written to such append-only virtual file, a.k.a. Ledger. This design makes Pulsar’s broker stateless; hence upon sudden surge in traffic, it can scale out in seconds - adding more nodes and spreading the topics among them automatically (see load balancer feature below), without any data movement needed in Pulsar.<br />
          A topic is, in fact, a list of ledgers (virtual append-only files). The active ledger is closed each configurable size/time, and a new one is opened and used.<br />
          Apache Bookkeeper can also scale out in seconds. When adding nodes, no data movement is required. Since actively written topics keep replacing their active ledger, the new bookkeeper nodes are also selected, as part of a uniform selection process to host new files, hence balancing out the message writes. This means the new nodes help balance the high surge of traffic immediately.

          Pulsar has a built-in framework called <a target='_blank' href='https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/io-overview/'>Pulsar IO</a>, which simplifies authoring and executing Connectors, which enables reading data from a third-party system into a Pulsar topic or writing messages stored in Pulsar topics to a third-party system.
          <br />
          <br />
          Pulsar has several officially maintained connectors of popular 3rd parties: MySQL, Elasticsearch, Cassandra, and more. The complete list is available <a target='_blank' href='https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/io-connectors/'>here</a>.
          <br />
          <br />
          Pulsar IO was written on top of Pulsar Functions, so a Connector (be it Sink or Source) is a Pulsar Function. The connector runs using Pulsar Function Worker based on the runtime chosen (thread, process, or K8s pod). This means it also supports parallelism (increasing the number of instances running the connector and dividing the work among them).

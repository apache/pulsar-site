## Release integrity

You must [verify](https://www.apache.org/info/verification.html) the integrity of the downloaded files. We provide OpenPGP signatures for every release file. This signature should be matched against the [KEYS](https://downloads.apache.org/pulsar/KEYS) file which contains the OpenPGP keys of Pulsar's Release Managers. We also provide `SHA-512` checksums for every release file. After you download the file, you should calculate a checksum for your download, and make sure it is the same as ours.

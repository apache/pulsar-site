## Apache Pulsar Project Management Committee (PMC) Email Contact

:::note
Please only send an email to the Pulsar PMC when you have concerns about the project that cannot be handled in public, such as security concerns about possible security vulnerabilities that aren't already public. Public CVEs can be discussed on the public mailing lists.
:::

The [Apache Pulsar Project Management Committee (PMC) members](https://pulsar.apache.org/community/#section-community) can be reached by sending an email to <a href="mailto:private@pulsar.apache.org">private@pulsar.apache.org</a>. 

## Project Decisions

All project decisions (excluding new security issues) are made by the whole community [in the Apache way](https://community.apache.org/committers/decisionMaking.html) on the [dev@pulsar.apache.org mailing list](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@pulsar.apache.org).<br/>
The most important thing about engaging with any Apache project is that everyone is equal. All project participants with an opinion can express that opinion and, where appropriate, have the community consider it.<br/>
Please join the dev mailing list using <a href="#mailing-lists">the instructions above</a>, and then send your project proposals, feedback, opinions, or suggestions to dev@pulsar.apache.org when it's not a security concern or another concern that shouldn't be disclosed to the public.<br/>
Pulsar project decisions are usually documented in the form of [Pulsar Improvement Proposals (PIPs)](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/tree/master/pip#pulsar-improvement-proposal-pip).

## Reporting a Security Vulnerability

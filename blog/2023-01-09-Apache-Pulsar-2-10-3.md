<!--truncate-->

### Add `getState` in transactions for client APIs ([PR-17423](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/17423))

#### Issue
In earlier versions, the state of transactions on the client side could not be obtained with the client APIs. Users have no way to check the state of transactions before ending them.

#### Resolution
Add an interface to get the state of transactions.

### Enable delayed transaction messages ([PR-17548](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/17548))

#### Issue
In earlier versions, delayed message delivery and transaction messages could not be used simultaneously. When sending a transaction message with a certain delay and committing this transaction, the messages sent by transactions are immediately received by consumers without any expected delay.

#### Resolution
Allow clients to send delayed messages with transactions using `trackDelayedDelivery`.

### Allow configuring and disabling the size of `lookahead` for detecting fixed delays in messages ([PR-17907](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/17907))

#### Issue
When detecting that all messages have a fixed delay time, it’s helpful that users can configure the size of `lookahead` to detect and pause the reads from cursors. But in earlier versions, the size of `lookahead is pre-defined and fixed, which lacks flexibility and limits the usage.

#### Resolution
Allow configuring and disabling the size of `lookahead` for detecting fixed delays in messages.

### Fix memory leak while offloading ledgers ([PR-18500](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/18500))

#### Issue
In earlier versions, `BlockAwareSegmentInputStreamImpl` never releases the BookKeeper entries in the `close` method, leading to `OutOfDirectMemory` errors on brokers that frequently run offloading activities. This PR fixes the incorrect `if` conditions.

### Fix namespace cannot be deleted by force ([PR-18307](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/18307))

#### Issue
In earlier versions, when you delete a namespace by force, if `__transaction_buffer_snapshot` and `__change_events` (system topic for topic policies) have been deleted, then the deletion of regular topics will fail because it cannot clear the snapshots and topic policies.

#### Resolution
Delete regular topics before deleting system topics when deleting a namespace. And deleting the system topic `__change_events` does not clear its topic policy.

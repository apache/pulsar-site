2022 was an incredible year for Apache Pulsar as it witnessed strong community growth with the project becoming more stable, scalable, and secure.

We are grateful to all of our community members and those in the wider open-source community who contributed to the project. They are the reasons behind every step Pulsar has made over the past year.

Now, let’s take a look at some of the highlights in 2022.

## New Pulsar website

In May 2022, the Apache Pulsar community [launched its new website](https://lists.apache.org/thread/7nx3rm3cmpbw0ws1b62k17935xgyw2tj). The new appearance has a light blue background with the homepage structure redesigned. You can see [PIP-87](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/12637) and [PIP-113](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/13235) for more details. Following is a comparison of the websites.

Many community members [participated in the discussion and provided valuable feedback](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/15538#issuecomment-1125602899). Currently, the Pulsar community is still working to improve the reader experience by making key information more visible and accessible.

## Key events recap

## Pulsar ecosystem

In 2022, the Pulsar community worked with other open-source communities to add more integrations to the Pulsar ecosystem. Notable integrations include:

- [Spring for Apache Pulsar](https://spring.io/blog/2022/09/20/spring-for-apache-pulsar-0-1-0-m1-is-now-available): This project aims to provide Spring-friendly APIs, building blocks, and programming models for writing Java applications that interact with Apache Pulsar. For more information, read the blog [Spring for Apache Pulsar 0.1.0 available now](https://spring.io/blog/2022/12/15/spring-for-apache-pulsar-0-1-0-available-now).
- [Flink-Pulsar Sink Connector](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/docs/connectors/datastream/pulsar/#pulsar-sink): The Flink-Pulsar Sink Connector is part of the Flink-Pulsar DataStream Connector. It implements Flink’s new [SinkV2 API](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-177%3A+Extend+Sink+API) and allows you to write Flink job results back to Pulsar topics seamlessly.
- [HTTP Sink Connector](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/17719): The HTTP Sink Connector pushes records to any HTTP server with the record value in the body of POST method. The body of the HTTP request is the JSON representation of the record value.

## What’s next in 2023

The Pulsar community seeks to further improve the project from different aspects. For example, we plan on releasing the first long-term support (LTS) version of Pulsar to meet the needs of different users. For those who want a more stable Pulsar version, they can choose the LTS release. The Pulsar community will help improve and upgrade the LTS versions with bug fixes and security patches.

Additionally, we will also have more events coming for 2023, including Pulsar Summit North America and Pulsar Summit APAC.

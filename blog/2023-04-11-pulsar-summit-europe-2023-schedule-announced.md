## Featured sessions

This year, Pulsar Virtual Summit Europe will include tech deep dives, use cases, best practices, and insights into Pulsar’s global adoption and thriving community. Take a sneak peek below at a few of the featured sessions.

### Challenges of Hosting a Pulsar-as-a-Service Platform Under a Shared Responsibility Model

Edgaras Petovradzius, Senior Engineer, the LEGO Group

Mathias Ravn Tversted, Engineer, the LEGO Group 

This talk will explore the challenges the LEGO Group encountered to host and manage Pulsar-as-a-Service across multiple domains, and how they collaborated with StreamNative in the process. It will highlight how the organization used OAuth2 for authentication and its self-service management platform for access control of Pulsar resources. The speakers will also discuss their observability tooling, incorporating cloud-native tools like Prometheus and OTel collectors, as well as internal tools for metrics and an ELK stack. Finally, the presentation will share best practices for using Pulsar clients in various programming languages and explore alternative methods of producing and consuming messages. 

### Pulsar Observability in High-Topic Cardinality Deployments for Telco

Habip Kenan Üsküdar, DevGitOps Engineer, Axon Networks

Don't miss speaker Habip Kenan Üsküda from Axon Networks, as he shares the experience of building an observability stack using Grafana and Prometheus for their cloud-native platform based on Apache Pulsar. As the number of topic pairings scaled beyond 50,000, with the goal of exceeding 1 million, the team encountered major challenges in scaling their monitoring stack. The presentation will cover their innovative approach to partitioning labels and tenancy management, as well as their efforts to extend Grafana Agent Operators’ Helm Charts to overcome these bottlenecks.

### Building a Full Lifecycle Streaming Data Pipeline

Timothy Spann, Principal Developer Advocate for Data in Motion, Cloudera

David Kjerrumgaard, Systems Engineer, Developer Advocate and Author of "Pulsar in Action", StreamNative

Julien Jakubowski, Developer Advocate, StreamNative

Join Tim, David, and Julien as they delve into the process of building a full lifecycle streaming data pipeline using Apache Pulsar, Spring, Java, Apache Pinot, Trino, and Apache Iceberg. This session will provide an overview of each tool’s key features and capabilities, demonstrating their integration for a robust and efficient real-time streaming data pipeline. The talk will also cover best practices for using these tools together, as well as case studies and real-world examples of successful pipeline implementations.

### The Future of Metrics in Pulsar

‍Asaf Mesika, Principal Engineer, StreamNative 

In this session, Asaf Mesika will discuss the challenges of using observability metrics in Pulsar from both user and committer perspectives. He will highlight issues such as high topic count limitations, improper histogram use in Grafana, and implementation difficulties. The talk will also present a proposal to address these problems by adopting the OpenTelemetry Java SDK, offering insights for leveraging metrics in Pulsar.

### Pulsar in Finance - A Tale of a Migration 

George Orban, Tech Lead, Senior Architect, Quant Developer, Daiwa Capital Markets 

In this talk, George Orban will share the experience of migrating a pricing engine and trading system from TIBCO Rendezvous and other messaging solutions to Apache Pulsar. He will discuss the reasons for choosing Pulsar, its suitability for enterprise applications and finance, and how it improved their stack’s resilience, robustness, and speed. The presentation will also cover new functionalities gained through Pulsar’s richer semantics, lessons learned, tools developed and open-sourced during the migration, and the future of Pulsar at Daiwa.

### Oxia: Scaling Pulsar’s Metadata to 100x

Matteo Merli, Apache Pulsar PMC Chair, CTO, StreamNative

Join Apache Pulsar PMC Chair and StreamNative CTO, Matteo Merli, for the much-anticipated introduction of Oxia, a metadata store and coordination system designed to overcome the limitations of ZooKeeper in scaling Pulsar clusters. Learn first-hand the design goals, architecture, and development journey of Oxia. Matteo will also explain how Oxia’s design leverages modern cloud-native environments to provide a highly flexible and dynamic operational environment. Watch this keynote to learn more about scaling Pulsar’s metadata with Oxia and how it can improve the performance and scalability of Pulsar clusters.

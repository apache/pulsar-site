## `pulsar-daemon`

A wrapper around the pulsar tool that’s used to start and stop processes, such as ZooKeeper, bookies, and Pulsar brokers, in the background using nohup.

pulsar-daemon has a similar interface to the pulsar command but adds start and stop commands for various services. For a listing of those services, run pulsar-daemon to see the help output or see the documentation for the pulsar command.

### `start`
Start a service in the background using nohup.

**Tip**

> You can use flags to perform more tasks. For example, `pulsar-daemon start standalone -nfw -nss` can start Pulsar faster in the background (without function workers and stream storage). `pulsar-daemon start standalone` flags are the same as `pulsar standalone` flags. For the complete flag list, see flags of the `pulsar standalone` command on the [Pulsar Reference Site](https://pulsar.apache.org/reference).

Usage

```bash
pulsar-daemon start service
```

### `stop`
Stop a service that’s already been started using start.

Usage

```bash
pulsar-daemon stop service options
```

Options

|Flag|Description|Default|
|---|---|---|
|-force|Stop the service forcefully if not stopped by normal shutdown.|false|

### `restart`
Restart a service that has already been started.

```bash
pulsar-daemon restart service
```
